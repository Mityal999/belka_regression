A test task for belka-digital.

There is also a docker repository for it: https://hub.docker.com/r/mityal999/mlapp.
And a Postman json link for testing the api: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5e463a2796025586c459.

The data is sent via a request adress - this is temporary, because of a bugfix going on.
