A test task for belka-digital.
Has got an app.py for a server. 

There is also a docker repository for it: https://hub.docker.com/r/mityal999/mlapp.

And a Postman json link for testing the api: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/5e463a2796025586c459. 


version 2: "Вторая версия"

The data is sent normally. 
Launching docker containter will automatically run the app.py file.
Test with Postman. Link is above.


version 1: "Первая рабочая версия"

The data is sent via a request adress - this is temporary, because of a bugfix going on. 
Also there are three examples of data for user to send - all stored as json files.
